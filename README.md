## Submission for ECF AI Hackathon Challenge 1: Combatting misinformation and fake news

### Topic
- Vast amounts of misinformation on environmental issues are shared through mass media and are often amplified through social media.
- How can we leverage AI to identify and classify misinformation and fake news on climate in mass media? While working with journalists and editors to deliver credible, reliable, and compelling coverage?

### Our proposal
- Input: Social media post relevant to NGO topic
- Run LLM using NGO publications to factcheck the claim and produce a shareable social media post

### Benefits
- NGO staff have more time to work on core tasks
- Extends the lifetime of reports
- Produces easily shareable content
- Improves the brand/reputation of the NGO
- Counters fake news while spreading correct news

## Prototype completed during Hackathon
### Technology
- React frontend + Python backend
- Functional: Upload of screenshots and querying OpenAI API for factcheck
- Not yet functional: Integration of vectorised databased, sharing on social media, gallery, dashboard
